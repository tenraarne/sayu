            We are currently processing an overwhelming amount of applications. Please be patient with us.

We are a small and closely-knit team that has set out to create the most iconic images in architecture today. Since Mir was founded more than 20 years ago, we have worked under the conviction that we are able to propagate architecture and architects that aspire towards the different.

Our focus has always been to cultivate independent and self-reliant artists who can master all aspects of the craft -and to help each member of our team to find a good work/life balance.

            Senior artist.
        </div>
        <div class="article">
            As a senior artist at Mir you are able to produce images within the realm of our current production without in-depth training. It is a plus if you are adept in managing projects and dealing with clients, but not a must. Your background is more or less irrelevant to us, but we need to see a strong portfolio dealing with space and light.

            Junior artist.
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            As a junior artist, we do not expect you to have a lot of experience in the industry, but nonetheless, your portfolio has to be excellent. You have a strong passion for making images. Most likely you have a good grasp of the basics of composition, light, and so on, but you are looking for a team that can help you grow and to gain more practical experience in the industry. We are open to hiring people with little experience in architectural visualisation. Hence, it is ok if your portfolio features less relevant work, but you have to master the basics of a 3d software of your choice and Photoshop.
